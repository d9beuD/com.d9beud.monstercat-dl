# Getting started

`monstercat-dl` is a very simple to use command line tool. Itâ€™s written in PHP for development ease and speed of execution.

## Requirements

As this tool is written in PHP, there is only one requirement: PHP >= 7.4 must be installed on your computer.

## Install PHP

### On macOS

If you are a user of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), there is juste one command to execute in your terminal app. If you are **NOT** a Homebrew user, you should realy take a look at it.

```
brew install php
```

### On Linux

Linux users already know what to do, but in case not, here is an example using APT.

```
apt install php
```

### On Windows

Well, you are lucky: PHP provides an [installer](https://www.php.net/downloads) for you. Just double-click it and follow instructions.
